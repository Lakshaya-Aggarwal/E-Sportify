## Introduction
The Esports industry is experiencing exponential growth, with influencer marketing becoming increasingly critical for brand engagement and audience reach. Traditional methodologies for influencer identification often fall short, relying on simplistic follower counts and surface-level engagement metrics. E-Sportify addresses these challenges by implementing advanced algorithmic techniques that provide a nuanced understanding of influencer networks.

### Problem Statement
Current methods for evaluating influencers lack the depth needed to capture the complexities of the Esports ecosystem. This project aims to develop a sophisticated, data-driven solution that:
- Implements advanced algorithmic techniques.
- Provides multi-dimensional influencer network analysis.
- Creates an intuitive visualization dashboard.

## Project Goals
1. **Advanced Influencer Detection**: Develop a nuanced influencer ranking system that moves beyond traditional metrics.
2. **Network Relationship Mapping**: Visualize complex interconnections within Esports influencer networks.
3. **Analytical Methodology Development**: Design a scalable model for cross-platform influencer evaluation.
4. **Visualization and Accessibility**: Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for user-friendly data interpretation.

## Methodology
The project's methodology includes:
- **Data Collection**: Utilizing YouTube API for data extraction on influencers.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Employing PageRank and URL Ranking Algorithms to assess influencer significance based on network connections and engagement metrics.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating multiple algorithms to identify the most effective approach for influencer ranking.

## Features
- **Influencer Detection**: Identify not only top-tier influencers but also emerging talents with significant potential.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into influencer performance and network relationships.
- **Data Integration**: Combines various metrics such as subscriber count, view count, and engagement rates for a holistic analysis.

## Installation
To set up the E-Sportify project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
